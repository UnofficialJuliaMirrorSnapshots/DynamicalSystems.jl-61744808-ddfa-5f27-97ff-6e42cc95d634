# Periodicity
In this page we describe methods related to the periodic behavior of dynamical systems or univariate timeseries.

## Detecting Stable and Unstable Periodic Orbits of Maps
Chaotic behavior
of low dimensional dynamical systems is affected by the position and the stability properties of the [periodic orbits](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Unstable_periodic_orbits) of a dynamical system.

Finding unstable (or stable) periodic orbits of a discrete mapping analytically
rapidly becomes impossible for higher orders of fixed points.
Fortunately there is a numeric algorithm due to
Schmelcher & Diakonos which allows such a computation. Notice that even though
the algorithm can find stable fixed points, it is mainly aimed at *unstable* ones.

The functions `periodicorbits` and `lambdamatrix` implement the algorithm:

### Standard Map example
For example, let's find the fixed points of the [Standard Map](system_definition/#DynamicalSystems.Systems.standardmap) of order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 8. We will use all permutations for the `signs` but only one for the `inds`.
We will also only use one `λ` value, and a 21×21 density of initial conditions.

First, initialize everything
```@example sm
using DynamicalSystems, PyPlot, StaticArrays

ds = Systems.standardmap()
xs = range(0, stop = 2π, length = 21); ys = copy(xs)
ics = [SVector{2}(x,y) for x in xs for y in ys]

# All permutations of [±1, ±1]:
singss = lambdaperms(2)[2] # second entry are the signs

# I know from personal research I only need this `inds`:
indss = [[1,2]] # <- must be container of vectors!!!

λs = 0.005 # <- only this allowed to not be vector (could also be vector)

orders = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
ALLFP = Dataset{2, Float64}[];
```
Then, do the necessary computations for all orders

```@example sm
for o in orders
    FP = periodicorbits(ds, o, ics, λs, indss, singss)
    push!(ALLFP, FP)
end
```

Plot the phase space of the standard map
```@example sm
iters = 1000
dataset = trajectory(ds, iters)
for x in xs
    for y in ys
        append!(dataset, trajectory(ds, iters, SVector{2}(x, y)))
    end
end
figure(figsize = (12,12))
m = Matrix(dataset)
PyPlot.scatter(view(m, :, 1), view(m, :, 2), s= 1, color = "black")
PyPlot.xlim(xs[1], xs[end])
PyPlot.ylim(ys[1], ys[end]);
```

and finally, plot the fixed points
```@example sm
markers = ["D", "^", "s", "p", "h", "8"]
colors = ["b", "g", "r", "c", "m", "grey"]

for i in 1:6
    FP = ALLFP[i]
    o = orders[i]
    PyPlot.plot(columns(FP)...,
    marker=markers[i], color = colors[i], markersize=10.0 + (8-o), linewidth=0.0,
    label = "order $o", markeredgecolor = "yellow", markeredgewidth = 0.5)
end
legend(loc="upper right", framealpha=0.9)
xlabel("\$\\theta\$")
ylabel("\$p\$")
savefig("fixedpoints.png"); nothing # hide
```
![Fixed points of the standard map](fixedpoints.png)

You can confirm for yourself that this is correct, for many reasons:

1. It is the same [fig. 12 of this publication](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.012914).
2. Fixed points of order $n$ are also fixed points of order $2n, 3n, 4n, ...$
3. Besides fixed points of previous orders, *original* fixed points of
   order $n$ come in (possible multiples of) $2n$-sized pairs (see e.g. order 5).
   This is a direct consequence of the Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem.

## Determining Periodicity

Once you have determined that your system is periodic, you might want to find out what its period is.  Fortunately, the function [`estimate_period`](@ref) from `ChaosTools` offers many ways for you to do this, given the system's timeseries as an input.

```@docs
estimate_period
```

We offer five methods to estimate periods, some of which work on evenly sampled data only, and others which accept any data.  The figure below summarizes this:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/master/videos/chaos/periodestimationmethods.png?raw=true)

### Example
Here we will use a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo system that results in periodic behavior, and then try to estimate its period. First, let's see the trajectory:
```@example sm
using DynamicalSystems, PyPlot

function FHN(u, p, t)
    e, b, g = p
    v, w = u
    dv = min(max(-2 - v, v), 2 - v) - w
    dw = e*(v - g*w + b)
    return SVector(dv, dw)
end

g, e, b  = 0.8, 0.04, 0.0
p0 = [e, b, g]

fhn = ContinuousDynamicalSystem(FHN, SVector(-2, -0.6667), p0)
T = 1000.0
v = trajectory(fhn, T; dt = dt)[:, 1]
t = 0:dt:T

figure()
plot(0:dt:T, v)
savefig("fhn_trajectory.png"); nothing # hide
```
Examining the figure, one can see that the period of the system is around `91` time units. To estimate it numerically let's use some of the methods:
```@example sm
estimate_period(vs, :autocorrelation, t)
```
```@example sm
estimate_period(vs, :periodogram, t)
```
```@example sm
estimate_period(vs, :zerocrossing, t)
```
